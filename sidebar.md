###Rules

____________


**1. 
Posts MUST show a clear human face. No posts showing only body parts.**

* Any post not showing a clear face will be removed and the poster banned. No posts with just pics of body parts below the shoulders. It risks non-consensual porn violations and will result in you being banned. Also, no AI pics, anime, drawings, cartoons, ancient Roman erotic wall paintings, etc.

**2.
No SnapChat, Discord, Telegram, Spam, Instagram, Facebook, etc.**

* Links to SnapChat, Discord, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, and other similar social (or antisocial) media is banned.

**3.
Ask a question, and only one (maybe 2) posts per day, per user.**

* Limit yourself to one (maybe 2, on occasion) post per day.

**4. 
Requests only.**

* If you post anything other than a request for ID or video your post will be removed. If you shit-post, you will be banned. No memes, no commentary posts, no requests for pizza or whatever. Make a request in your post. If you title your post with anything other than that, your post will be removed. Single words are allowed. Leading questions commonly used by spammers and content producers, such as "Would you fuck me?" or "Would you still date me if...xxxxxxxx?" will be removed as spam.

**5.
Thank people here that help you, and be polite.**

* People are taking time to help you. Why not thank them? You (should have) learned this in kindergarten. If you didn't, you're probably not old or mature enough to be in this subreddit to begin with. Leave your extreme politics, opinions, and harassment out of this sub.

**6.
Do not ask for or post leaks or fakes/deepfakes. Those are non-consensual porn, and illegal.**

* Do not ask for "leaked" pics of anyone, post leaks, or in any way offer to exchange them. Do not post fakes or deepfakes - altered images where one person's face or body part is superimposed on another person's image, often with the use of Photoshop. Automatic ban and report to the Admins for non-consensual porn. This also applies to any names, links, or info that a person formerly made public, but now wants to not be public.

**7. 
Do not ask for or offer money for anything, or exchange content via any kind of private message.**

* Do not offer money as a reward for finding a result, or anything. Do not ask for money for anything, especially selling access to files/folders/mega links/ANYTHING, or ask people to post them, including "Where can I find this for free?" requests. This also applies to cam models spamming their OnlyFans, Fansly, IG, personal pages, or any other promotional post or material. Do not offer or ask for content via private message ("PM" or "DM").

**8.
NO UNDERAGE posts, nor any that look like they're underage.**

* No underage content. No asking about it, identifying performers, posting names, or even joking about it. Seriously, if you have to question what this means, don't post anything at all.

**9
DO NOT POST PERSONAL INFORMATION. NONE.**

* A performer's stage name, a content creator's public user name or identity, and/or their public information is permitted. Since this needs to be spelled out: Any personal information is prohibited. If the public celebrity goes by a public name, DO NOT post their real/legal name. Don't post where they live, their home life info, their dogs name, NONE of it. This also applies to info that was formerly made public by a person that wishes to remove themselves from the public view.
